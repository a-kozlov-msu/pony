## Detailed descriptions

### `pony_ins_gravity_constant`

Takes the magnitude of average accelerometer output vector and puts it into vertical gravity component, 
which then remains constant. 

Recommended for low-grade systems, especially when no reference coordinates available.

### `pony_ins_gravity_normal`

Computes conventional Earth normal gravity model as in GRS80, etc., 
but takes Earth model constants from pony->imu_const variables. 
Accounts for both latitude and altitude, as well as for plumb line curvature above ellipsoid.

Recommended for conventional navigation grade systems.

### (planned) `pony_ins_gravity_egm08`

Planned for future development.


### `pony_ins_alignment_static`

Conventional averaging of accelerometer and gyroscope outputs.
Then constructing the attitude matrix out of those averages.
Also calculates attitude angles (roll, pitch, yaw=true heading), and quaternion.

Recommended for navigation/tactical-grade systems on a highly stable static base,
e.g. turntable or stabilized plate.

### `pony_ins_alignment_rotating`

Approximation of gravity vector rotating along with the Earth in an inertial reference frame.
Then estimating northern direction via gravity vector displacement.
Also calculates attitude angles (roll, pitch, yaw=true heading), and quaternion.

Recommended for navigation-grade systems on a rotating base, 
allowing vibrations with zero average acceleration,
e.g. an airplane standing still on the ground with engine(s) running.

### `pony_ins_alignment_rotating_rpy`

The same as `pony_ins_alignment_rotating`, but attitude matrix is calculated using attitude angles
(roll, pitch and yaw=true heading). Does not allow the first instrumental axis to point upwards.

Recommended for navigation-grade systems on a rotating base, 
allowing vibrations with zero average acceleration,
with pitch angle not exceeding 80Â°.


### `pony_ins_attitude_rodrigues`

Combines angular rate components or their integrals into Euler rotation vector 
for both instrumental frame and navigation frame. Then applies Rodrigues' rotation formula 
to each frame. Then derives the transition matrix between them. Quaternion and angles are also updated.

Recommended for navigation/tactical grade systems.

### (planned) `pony_ins_attitude_madgwick`

Planned for future development.


### `pony_ins_motion_euler`

Numerically integrates Newton's second Law in local level navigation frame 
using first-order Euler's method over the Earth reference ellipsoid. 
Updates velocity and geographical coordinates. 

Not suitable near the Earth's poles.

### (planned) `pony_ins_attitude_madgwick`

Planned for future development.

### `pony_ins_motion_vertical_damping`

Restrains vertical error exponential growth by either damping
vertical velocity to zero, or to an external reference like
altitude/rate derived from air data system and/or gnss, etc.

Recommended when using normal gravity model and/or long navigation timeframe.
